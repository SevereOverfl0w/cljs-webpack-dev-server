# io.dominic.webpack-dev-server

## Demo instructions

1. Start a dev system as normal & open your browser to localhost:3000
2. In a new terminal, run `npx webpack serve`
3. Change coolfoo/index.js
4. See the browser hot reload the JavaScript dependency!

### How it works

There's a new entrypoint, hot.js.
hot.js hooks into the webpack HMR system, and triggers a reload of any ClojureScript namespaces which are using `require('coolfoo')`.
Following a reload, a reload function is called to trigger a re-render.

### What doesn't work

* Namespace list doing a `require()` is hardcoded
* List of JavaScript dependencies to hot reload is hardcoded in hot.js.  This means a new `coolfoo/bar` wouldn't be replaced.
* The reload uses figwheel and therefore triggers a full re-fetch of JavaScript which shouldn't be necessary.

## Useful Commands

Start a dev system

$ clj -A:dev
user=> (dev)
dev=> (go)

Create figwheel release build

$ clj -T:fig:build cljs

Create release docker tar

$ clj -T:fig:build docker

Run release docker tar

$ podman load < target/webpack-dev-server.tar.gz
$ podman run --rm -p 3000:3000 io.dominic/webpack-dev-server
